 The existing ways for career guidance includes seminars, counseling and analysis based on academic performance, considering aspects and parameters such as economic status, future job perspectives and etc. which may turn out to be irrelevant for determining better and suitable profession for students. There are various other alternatives existing, but none of them provide a concrete and precise solution to the problem. We therefore come with a concept of application which takes into consideration the sheer interest of students as the single parameter for recommending areas of interest. This application will be designed for educational usage. Surveys will be taken to generate results, the results will be stored in database on which machine learning algorithm will be implemented followed by a regular tracking of student’s performance, and thus generating informative reports
